For this project, you are required to develop an application using any tech stack of your choice. Your project must meet the following criteria:
1.	Utilize a non-relational database (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB).
2.	Incorporate a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3.	Implement features that enhance scalability (e.g., caching).
4.	Any Backend framework (e.g, Fast API, Flask, Go )
Integrating AI capabilities (API Integration with any AI platform) into your project is optional but will be considered a valuable addition. This project is an opportunity to demonstrate your ability to build scalable and modern applications. It can also be added onto your resume since you will be using industry relevant tools.
The teams will remain the same. Please keep me informed about any changes in the team but every team must contain 4 people.
The due date for this project will be December 10th 2024.
